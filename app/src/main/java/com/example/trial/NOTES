Gravity is used to make center
first i have to create linear horizontal layout
    set constrains as : layout_height=wrap content
                      : layout_width=0
                      : bottom_constrain=0
                      :left and right constrains=0
put card view inside the layout
    change cardview corner radius = 8
    set margin as 10 dp
inside card view put a text view and display a text Moves: 0 and make it center using gravity
